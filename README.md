# ChildVoice
The ‘Child Voice’ project is about creating software that uses 'story stem' theory to inspire children's creativity and help the child to communicate. It is to create a series of scenarios of real-life where it will provide children various choices to customize their own story.

The scenario of the story will base on the ‘story stem’ mechanism, which is a kind of dialogue about relationships and problems, particularly within the family. How the story stem works is that let the children finish the incomplete story scenario to diagnose the potential problem the children have in the real-life

The project is still in the development stage, and be expected to be completed in May 2022. More details will be available soon.
Developed with Unreal Engine 4
